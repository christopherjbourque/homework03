# Project Title
homework3


## Motivation

I was required to create this web app for my Bootcamp program through Carleton University.  While we were provided with code for the GUI component, I decided to create my own web page to make this a true web app.  I did this out of personal interest and curiosity and to try and push myself a little given my coding knowledge and experience at this stage of my bootcamp program.
